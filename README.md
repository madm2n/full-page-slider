## Full page slider

### Full page slider implemented with vanilla JS. This was made for future reference in projects if needed. If you want to use it in your project please take a look at `js` implementation by referencing `js/script.js`. 

### Don't forget about styles. Also this was made to be compatible with modern browsers, so if you need `ie11` support please keep in mind that this won't work and you'll need to make some tweaks.
